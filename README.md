# SWGOH Stat Calculator Readme #

Calculates unit stats for EA's Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes based on player data.
Accepted data formats are those found in [swgoh.help's API](http://api.swgoh.help) endpoints, specifically the 'player.roster' object from their `/player` endpoint.

One additional data format is supported as well -- referred to as 'raw' in this documentation, it's a more 'pure' format based on the objects directly returned by the game's servers.

## Setup ##

### Node.js ###

#### Installation ####
`npm install swgoh-stat-calc`

#### Initialization ####
```js
const statCalculator = require('swgoh-stat-calc');
statCalculator.setGameData( gameData );
```

### Raw JavaScript ###
The `statCalculator.js` file is the complete calculator object, and has no dependencies on Node-specific packages.
It can run just as well in any browser/system with at least ES6 compatibility.
If used outside of npm, copy that file to a location your project can access, and adjust the `require()` parameter to point to that file, such as:
```js
const statCalculator = require('./statCalculator.js');
```

## Methods ##

Examples below make use of the [api-swgoh-help](https://github.com/r3volved/api-swgoh-help/tree/node) package (loaded into variable `swapi`) to collect the raw data.
See it's documentation to learn more about how to use it to gather this data.

* [.setGameData(gameData)](#setgamedatagamedata)
* [.calcCharStats(char, options)](#calccharstatschar--options-)
* [.calcShipStats(ship, crew, options)](#calcshipstatsship-crew--options-)
* [.calcRosterStats(roster, options)](#calcrosterstatsunits--options-)
* [.calcPlayerStats(player, options)](#calcplayerstatsplayers--options-)
* [.calcCharGP(char, options)](#calcchargpchar--options-)
* [.calcShipGP(ship, crew, options)](#calcshipgpship-crew--options-)

### .setGameData(gameData) ###

Tells the Stat Calculator what to use for the base Game Data.
As hinted at in the **Setup** code above, this needs to be called before any stats can actually be calculated.
Can also be used later to update / reassign the game data, if an update is detected and loaded externally.

#### Paramters ####

`gameData` *Object*\
The Obect used by the Stat Calculator to read raw game data.  It requires a specific format.
An example JSON file of the proper `gameData` object can be found [here](https://swgoh-stat-calc.glitch.me/gameData.json).
That link should remain active and updated, and thus can be used directly to create the data object.
To create the object from [swgoh.help's](http://api.swgoh.help) `/data` endpoint, see the code in [dataBuilder.js](https://glitch.com/edit/#!/swgoh-stat-calc?path=statCalc/dataBuilder.js). (A separate package for this code will be created in the future, but for now, it's just hiding in that project).

#### Return Value ####

None.

#### Example ####

```js
// uses 'node-fetch' for the GET request to retrieve the gameData object
const fetch = require('node-fetch');
const statCalculator = require('swgoh-stat-calc');

let gameData = await (await fetch('https://swgoh-stat-calc.glitch.me/gameData.json')).json();
statCalculator.setGameData( gameData );
```

### .calcCharStats(char [, options] ) ###

## Options ##

The `options` parameter of all calculation methods is an object that can contain any of the following properties.
Any additional properties of the object will be ignored.\
The *Default* explanations below are what is used when the related flag(s) are not used.

#### Example ####
```js
{ gameStyle: true, unscaled: true }
```

### Calculation control ###

`calcGP: true`\
Runs GP calculations along with any specified stat calculations, and stores its value in the unit's
`.gp` property, as well as in the `.stats` object as `.stats.gp`.

The GP value will be inaccurate for `/units` style objects since it is missing values that are needed
for the GP calculation, such as relic level, skills, and whether the ultimate is unlocked for galactic
legends.

`onlyGP: true`\
Implies calcGP. Skips all stat calculations and only calculates the GP.

`withoutModCalc: true`\
Speeds up character calculations by ignoring stats from mods.\
*Default* - calculate mods stats for all characters that include them.

`useValues: {Object}`\
Overrides unit parameters with specific values.
Object structure and total options are as defined below.
Parameters provided here can be missing in the original unit.
```js
{
  char: { // used when calculating character stats
    rarity: 1-7,
    level: 1-90,
    gear: 1-12,
    equipped: "all" || "none" || [1,2,3,4,5,6], // See Below
    relic: 1-9 // 1='locked', 2='unlocked', 3=R1, 4=R2, ...9=R7
    skills: "max" || "maxNoZeta" || 1-8, // See below
    modRarity: 1-7,
    modLevel: 1-15,
    modTier: 1-5,
  },
  ship: { // used when calculating ship stats
    rarity: 1-7,
    level: 1-90
  },
  crew: { // used for characters when calculating ship stats
    rarity: 1-7,
    level: 1-90,
    gear: 1-12,
    equipped: "all" || "none" || [1,2,3,4,5,6] || 1-6, // See Below
    skills: "max" || "maxNoZeta" || 1-8, // See Below
    modRarity: 1-7,
    modLevel: 1-15,
    modTier: 1-5,
    relic: 1-9 // 1='locked', 2='unlocked', 3=R1, 4=R2, ...9=R7
  }
}
```
>`char.equipped` / `crew.equipped` - gear currently equipped on characters/crew:
>* *"all"* - all possible gear at the current level.
>* *"none"* - no gear at the current level.
>* *Array* - List of filled slots.  Slots are numbered 1-6, left to right, starting at the top by in-game UI.
>* *Integer* - Number, 1-6, of gear pieces equipped at current level.  Only valid for crew.

>`char.relic` / `crew.relic` - Relic 'Tier' to use\
>Used as the `relic.currentTier` property in .help's data format.\
>Values of 1 and 2 are for 'locked' and 'unlocked', while values >2 are 2 more than the actual Relic Level.

>`crew.skills` - skill level to use for all crew members' abilities:
>* *"max"* - Max possible level.
>* *"maxNoZeta"* - Leaves zeta abilities at level 7, but uses max level for all others.
>* *Integer* - Number, 1-8, to use for all abilities, if possible.\
8 or higher is identical to *"max"*.


*Default* - uses the values defined by the unit objects submitted.\
This applies to each individual property of the `useValues` object, not just the option as a whole.


### Value control ###

`percentVals: true`\
Converts internal flat values for Defense (Armor/Resistance) and Crit Chance (Special/Physical) to the percentages displayed in-game.
Uses the decimal form (i.e. 10% is returned as 0.1)\
*Default* - return the flat values for above stats.

`scaled: true` / `unscaled: true`\
Matches scaling status of values used internally to the game (as seen in portions of [swgoh.help's](http://api.swgoh.help) `/data` endpoint).\
>`scaled` - multiplies all values by 10,000.  All non-modded stats should be integers at this scale.\
`unscaled` - multiplies all values by 100,000,000.  All stats (including mods) fit as integers at this scale.\
*Default* - Stats returned at the expected scale as seen in-game.  Non-percent stats (like Speed) should be integers, all percent stats (like Potency) will be decimals

### Stats Object Style ###

*Default*\
The default Stats Object Style has the following properties:
>`base` *all units* - The base value of of the unit's stats without any stats from mods/gear/crew.
For characters, these are the values used in mods with a percent bonus.
>`gear` *characters* - Amount of stat granted by currently equipped gear (and unused within mod calculations).\
>`mods` *characters* - Amount of stat granted by mods.\
>`crew` *ships* - Amount of stat granted by crew rating.

`gameStyle: true`\
Activates the `percentVals` flag above, and also changes the Stats Object to have the following properties:
>`final` *all units* - Sums values from base, gear, mods, and/or crew into the total stat value.\
>`gear` *characters* - Amount of stat granted by currently equipped gear (and unused within mod calculations).\
>`mods` *characters* - Amount of stat granted by mods.\
>`crew` *ships* - Amount of stat granted by crew rating.


### Stat Naming Options ###

`language: {Object}`\
Tells the calculator to rename the stats using the submitted object.
Used mostly for localization.
*Object* must be such that `options.language[ statID ]` is the stat name, i.e. `{"1": "Health",...}`.\
An example English localization can be seen [here](https://swgoh-stat-calc.glitch.me/lang/eng_us.json).\
Note that a large enough array will also work, as can be seen [here](https://swgoh-stat-calc.glitch.me/lang/statEnum.json).

**Note on `language` keys:** The object/array for `options.language` does not need to be as complete as the above examples
(which cover all 60 possible stats in game code).  Some statIDs that exist in game code are not used (such as id 59 - "UnitStat_Taunt"),
and even more are not returned by this API (such as id 57 - "Speed %" - which converted to the flat "Speed" value, id 5).\
Any statIDs that are not in `options.language` will remain indexed as that integer ID in the return object.

`noSpace: true`\
Converts any stat name strings used in the `language` option into standard camelCase with no spaces.
Only affects stat names defined in that parameter.\
I.e. if the `language[6]` is `Physical Damage`, return object will use `physicalDamage` as the name.

## Object Formats ##

### "*Native*" format -- [swgoh.help's](http://api.swgoh.help) `/player` ###

Player profile object.  Contains a `.roster` property with an array of unit objects.

**Full profile:**
```js
{
  roster: [
    {
      defId: <String>,
      rarity: <Integer>,
      level: <Integer>,
      gear: <Integer>,
      equipped: [
        {
          equipmentId: <String>
        },
      ... ],
      skills: [ // skill list only required for crew members when calculating ship stats
        {
          tier: <Integer>,
          id: <String> // id only needed for GP calculations
        },
      ... ],
      mods: [ // can be skipped if using `withoutModCalc` flag for characters only
        {
          pips: <Integer>,
          set: <Integer>,
          tier: <Integer>, // tier only needed for GP calculations
          level: <Integer>,
          primaryStat: {
            unitStat: <Integer>,
            value: <Number>
          },
          secondaryStat: [
            {
              unitStat: <Integer>,
              value: <Number>
            },
          ... ]
        }
      ... ],
      relic: {
        currentTier: <Integer>
      }
    },
  ... ]
}
```
Used directly by `.calcPlayerStats()`, which also accepts an array of these objects (and [swgoh.help's](http://api.swgoh.help) `/player` endpoint always returns an array)

**player.roster**\
Used directly by `.calcRosterStats()`

**Unit**  *single element of* `player.roster`\
Used directly by `.calcCharStats()` and `.calcShipStats()` (for both the ship and the crew members).

### "*Units*" format -- [swgoh.help's](http://api.swgoh.help) `/units` ###

Object indexed by unit's base ID.  Each such property is an array of unit objects.

**Full Object:**
```js
{
  <BaseID>: [
    {
      starLevel: <Integer>,
      level: <Integer>,
      gearLevel: <Integer>,
      gear: [ <String>, ... ],
      mods: [
        {
          set: <Integer>,
          level: <Integer>,
          stat: [
            [ <Integer>, <Number> ],
          ... ]
        }
      ... ]
    },
  ... ],
  <BaseID>: [ ... ],
... }
```
Only allowed by `.calcRosterStats()`.
As skill info is not included in this format, ship stats cannot be processed.
Only characters will have their stats calculated.
Relic levels are not available in this format, so stats granted by relics will not be included.

**Note:** [swgoh.help's](http://api.swgoh.help) `/roster` endpoint is an array of these objects.
While that array is not directly accepted, each element in the array is a "Units" style object that is accepted as stated above.

### "*Raw*" format -- direct from game ###

Player profile object.  Contains a `.rosterUnit` property with an array of unit objects.

**Full profile:**
```js
{
  rosterUnit: [
    {
      definitionId: <String>,
      currentRarity: <Integer>,
      level: <Integer>,
      currentTier: <Integer>,
      equipment: [
        {
          equipmentId: <String>
        },
      ... ],
      skill: [ // skill list only required for crew members when calculating ship stats
        {
          tier: <Integer>,
          id: <String> // id only needed for GP calculations
        },
      ... ],
      equippedStatMod: [ // can be skipped if using `withoutModCalc` flag for characters only
        {
          definitionId: <String>
          level: <Integer>,
          tier: <Integer>, // only needed for GP calculations
          primaryStat: {
            stat: {
              unitStat: <Integer>,
              unscaledDecimalValue: <Integer>
            }
          },
          secondaryStat: [
            {

                unitStatId: <Integer>,
                unscaledDecimalValue: <Integer>
              }
            },
          ... ]
        }
      ... ],
      relic: {
        currentTier: <Integer>
      }
    },
  ... ]
}
```

**player.rosterUnit**\
Used directly by `.calcRosterStats()`

**Unit**  *single element of* `player.roster`\
Used directly by `.calcCharStats()` and `.calcShipStats()` (for both the ship and the crew members).
